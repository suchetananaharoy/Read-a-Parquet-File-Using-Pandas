Concepts
Parquet format: A columnar storage format that is optimized for distributed processing of large datasets.
Partitioning: Dividing a dataset into smaller parts based on the values of one or more columns.
Pandas DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
pyarrow: A Python package that provides a Python interface to the Arrow C++ library for working with columnar data.

In conclusion, partitioning parquet files is a powerful way to optimize data storage and querying performance. By partitioning data based on one or more columns, you can easily filter, sort, and aggregate data within a subset of partitions, rather than having to scan the entire dataset.

In this article, we covered two methods for reading partitioned parquet files in Python: using pandas’ read_parquet() function and using pyarrow’s ParquetDataset class. We also provided several examples of how to read and filter partitioned parquet files using these methods with real-world weather data.

Overall, partitioning parquet files is an effective technique for optimizing data storage and retrieval. Whether you’re dealing with big data or just trying to improve query performance, partitioning can help you get the most out of your data.
